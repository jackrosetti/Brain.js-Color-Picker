First time using the brain.js library. This is pretty basic, but I have encountered this problem while creating websites. 
You can find the library here: https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js. In layman's terms, I added a bunch of examples of when white text would be needed and when black text would be needed. The program then calculates the odds of needing light or dark text. Whichever one is higher gets chosen. Cheers!
